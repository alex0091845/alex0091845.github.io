    <h1>Chapter 1.1. The Concept of Objects</h1>
    <p>I know a lot of other tutorials start with printing out Hello World and things, and we'll do that, but I want to start with the core of Java--the concept of objects, because Java is all about objects and classes.</p>
    <p>I think all of us are familiar with the concept of objects once I explain it. It's pretty intuitive!</p>
    <p>The core idea is that there are <strong>classes of objects or instances</strong>. Not classes as in academic courses, but <strong>classifications of objects or instances.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, you might classify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Toyota Corolla, your friend's Subaru Crosstrek, and your family Honda CRV into a <code>Car</code> class.</li>
      <li>A pine tree, a maple tree, and a cedar tree into a <code>Tree</code> class.</li>
      <li>You, a friend of yours, and a family member of yours into a <code>Human</code> class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A more natural (though somewhat strange, still) way of saying these are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My family's Honda CRV is a Car.</li>
      <li>That pine tree is a Tree.</li>
      <li>My friend is a Human.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And even though these are all different, separate, individual "objects," <strong>every object in a class have similar states and actions associated with them</strong>.</p>
    <p>I wrote some examples below. See if you can come up with more!</p>

	<h2>Example</h2>

    <p>Let's say we have some human objects in our program (yes, unfortunately in the software world, we are all objectified). We can visualize them as below:</p>

	<table id="simple-table">
		<tr class="image-cell">
			<td>
				<div class="img">
					<img src="../assets/tommy.jpg" />
					<span><strong>human0</strong></span>

						<p>
							name = "Tommy"<br>
							age = 22<br>
							height = 5.4<br>
							isHungry = true<br>
							hydrationLevel = 7<br>
							energyLevel = 4
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="img" style="border-left: 1px solid black;">

						</p>
					</div>

			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p class="caption">Initial values</p>
      
    <p>Let's look at the object on the left. It has all the properties and actions as defined in the class. Let's name it human0. It has a name of "Tommy", an age of 22, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>For the object on the right, let's name it human1. It has a name of "Isabelle," an age of 26, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>When we tell human0 (aka Tommy) to take an action of <code>drink()</code> (yes, we tell objects to take actions), its <code>hydrationLevel</code> goes up. But notice Isabelle's <code>hydrationLevel</code> does not change.</p>

    <p><strong>So the actions usually change or alter the object's <em>own</em> states in some way</strong>.</p>

	<hr>
    
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each individual object can act based on the action you tell them to do, and only that object acts according to the instructions we have given it.</li>
      <li>Each individual object has their own states, and changing one object's states does not (usually) affect other objects' states.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might think, what's the big deal?</p>
      
    <p>Nothing! It's intuitive, right?</p>

    <p>Just because you clap, doesn't mean <em>your friend</em> will clap.</p>
      
    <p>Just because you're eating and getting less hungry, doesn't mean <em>your friend</em> is getting less hungry.</p>
      
    <p>What's nice is that <strong>these states and actions are summarized and described in these things called classes</strong>.</p>

    <p>You define states and actions for classes of objects. Then, each object acts similarly, but based on their own state.</p>
      
    <p>You should know from the fact that I just came up with the arbitrary states and actions above, that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There's no way to represent all states and actions of a real-world object in software.</li>
      <li>What states and actions you include and define are <em>up to you</em>.</li>
    </ol>
      
    <p>And guess what? Java already has a bunch of built-in classes--with their own states and actions--written and designed by other people. We can use them!</p>

    <p>For example, there is a class for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking in user input, called <code>Scanner</code></li>
      <li>Creating some colors so we can draw things, called <code>Color</code></li>
      <li>Working with files, called <code>File</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In Java, states are called <strong>fields</strong>. Actions are called <strong>methods</strong>. From now on, I'll use these terminology. Make sure to understand what I mean!</p>

	<h2>Uses of Classes and Objects</h2>

    <p>So… having said all this, what's the purpose of objects? Why do we need them?</p>
    
    <p>There are many uses of software objects, mostly when you want to treat a bunch of related information (fields) and action (methods) together into one unit (object):</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>In a game where you have players and enemies, you can have a Player class and an Enemy class.</li>
      <li>In a backend (data processing/management) software for hospitals, schools, banks, coffee shop, you can have a Patient class, a Student class, a BankAccount class, and a Customer and a PremiumCustomer class respectively.</li>
      <li>...and many more</li>
    </ul>

        Section Summary

      <p>Let's summarize what you learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A class:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Is defined by someone like you. People write their own classes all the time. Some people decide others can use the classes and the code they wrote.</li>
          <li>Describes fields and methods for any object/instance of that class.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>e.g., the Human class says that there's a field called name, and a method called drink() for any object of the Human class (any Human object)</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      
        <li>An object:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Has its own individual field values and act on its own</li>
          <ul>
            <li>e.g., the name field value for one Human object might be “Tommy.” The name field value for another might be “Isabelle.”</li>
            <li>e.g., while both Tommy and Isabelle's <code>hydrationLevel</code> goes up by 1 every time they drink, Tommy and Isabelle's <code>hydrationLevel</code>'s change individually.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <li>Object-oriented programming:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Is defining classes to create objects, and then telling those objects to take certain actions!</li>
